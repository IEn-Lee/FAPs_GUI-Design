Version 2.1.0 is based on Version 2.0.0, with added safety mechanisms when stopping the system.
In the SETTING tab, switching from STOP mode to START mode now requires pressing and holding the button for more than 3 seconds to prevent accidental activation by the user.
In addition, the actual counting of Elapsed Time and Cycles Completed has also been implemented.

**After testing, it has been confirmed that the false-touch prevention mechanism used in version 2.1.0 will be replaced by the double-check window introduced in version 2.2.0.**
