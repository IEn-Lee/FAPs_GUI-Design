# FAPs GUI-Design Project
This is a 10 ECTS project carried out during the WS2025 semester at FAU, under the topic "User Interface and Control Software for an Automated Test Bench for the Analysis of Biofilm Formation" in the FAPS department.

The project focuses on developing an Arduino-based automated test platform designed to simulate urination cycles and monitor biofilm formation on artificial urethral sphincter implants. The system includes a touch-based user interface and hardware control components such as a peristaltic pump, UV sterilization, and temperature sensing.
