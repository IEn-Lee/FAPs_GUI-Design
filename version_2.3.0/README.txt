Version 2.3.0 is based on version 2.2.0 with further enhancements to system monitoring and user feedback.
This update introduces support for the BMP280 sensor, enabling real-time temperature monitoring at one-second intervals.
The measured temperature is displayed in the Temp status within the DEVICE STATUS tab, as well as in the temperature chart at the bottom of the MONITOR tab.
Additionally, a live temperature label has been added to the top-right corner of the temperature chart in the MONITOR tab, providing users with a more convenient way to check current temperature readings.
